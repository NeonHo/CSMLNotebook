# Why we need Label Enhancement?

Most training sets:
1. only contain simple logical labels;
2. difficult to obtain the label distribution directly.
So we need to recover label distributions.
# How to label enhance?
1. use topological information of the feature space.
2. use correlation among the labels.
Label enhancement is **to recover label distribution from logical labels**.
