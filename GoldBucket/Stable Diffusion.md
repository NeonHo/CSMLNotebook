# What
- a deep learning model
	- use for: converting text to images
		- generate high-quality, photo-realistic images that look like real photographs by simply inputting any text.
	- Latest: Stable Diffusion XL
		- a larger UNet backbone network
			- generate even higher quality images.
	- How to use:
		- use the free AI image generator on Stable Diffusion Online.
		- search over 9 million Stable Diffusion prompts on Prompt Database.
		- Most NVidia and AMD GPUs with 8GB or more.
- train on:
	- the 2b English language label subset of LAION 5b https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/
- How it works.
	- Instead of operating in the high-dimensional image space, 
	- Stable Diffusion first compresses the image into the latent space. 
	- gradually destroys the image by adding noise, 
	- be trained to reverse this process and regenerate the image from scratch.
- Versions
	- SDXL Turbo (Stable Diffusion XL Turbo) is an improved version of SDXL 1.0 (Stable Diffusion XL 1.0)
	- SDXL Turbo implements a new distillation technique called Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD)
	- enables the model to synthesize images in a single step and generate real-time text-to-image outputs while maintaining high sampling fidelity.
- Open-source & free
- switch models flexible.
- 自动生成图片、艺术风格转换、人脸生成等.
	- 选择合适的模型进行切换，从而实现个性化的绘图效果。
