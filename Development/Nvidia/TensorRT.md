# runtime
In NVIDIA TensorRT, the term "runtime" refers to the TensorRT runtime library. It is a crucial component used for executing deep learning models during the inference stage. The TensorRT runtime library provides an efficient way to deploy and run deep learning models, particularly on NVIDIA GPUs.

The TensorRT runtime library includes optimizations and acceleration techniques for deep learning models to achieve low latency and high throughput in production environments. It leverages the parallel computing power of GPUs to accelerate model inference by reducing computation and memory overhead.

The TensorRT runtime library supports model import from various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, and others, enabling you to deploy models trained in these frameworks within TensorRT and harness the performance advantages of NVIDIA GPUs.

In summary, the TensorRT runtime library is a critical component for efficiently running deep learning inference on GPUs, accelerating model inference, and achieving better performance.
