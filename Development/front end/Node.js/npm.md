When you run the `npm install` command in a Node.js project directory, several things typically happen:

1. Dependency Resolution: npm (Node Package Manager) will analyze the `package.json` file in your project's root directory to determine the dependencies your project requires. This file lists the packages and their versions that your project relies on.

2. Download Packages: npm will connect to the npm registry (usually the default registry is https://registry.npmjs.org/) and download the specified packages and their dependencies. These packages are typically JavaScript libraries or modules that your project needs to function correctly.

3. Create `node_modules` Directory: npm will create a `node_modules` directory in your project's root folder (if it doesn't already exist) and place all the downloaded packages and their dependencies in this directory.

4. Install Dependencies: npm will install all the dependencies listed in your `package.json` file in the `node_modules` directory. It will also generate a `package-lock.json` file, which records the specific versions of each package that were installed. This helps ensure that your project uses the same package versions across different installations.

5. Execute Scripts: If your `package.json` file contains custom scripts in the `"scripts"` section (e.g., `"start"`, `"test"`, etc.), npm may run these scripts as part of the installation process. For example, running `npm install` may trigger the execution of an `"install"` script if defined.

6. Update `package.json`: If you use the `--save` or `--save-dev` flags with `npm install`, npm will automatically update your `package.json` file to add the newly installed packages as dependencies or devDependencies, respectively.

Running `npm install` is a common step when setting up or working on a Node.js project. It ensures that all required dependencies are installed and ready to use in your project, making it easier to manage and distribute your Node.js applications and libraries.

## 1.1. npm run dev
The `npm run dev` command is typically used in Node.js projects to start a development server or execute a development-related script specified in the `"scripts"` section of your project's `package.json` file. This command is often used to kickstart the development environment, run tasks like code compilation, and watch for changes during development.

Here's what happens when you run `npm run dev`:

1. Dependency Check: Before running the `npm run dev` script, npm will check if your project's dependencies are installed. If they are not already installed, you may need to run `npm install` to ensure that all required packages are available.

2. Execution of the Script: When you run `npm run dev`, npm will execute the script associated with the `"dev"` key in the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json` file. For example, if your `package.json` contains:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "node server.js"
   }
   ```

   Running `npm run dev` will execute `node server.js`.

3. Development Server or Build Process: The specific behavior of `npm run dev` depends on how you've configured the script in your `package.json` file. It can perform various tasks such as starting a development server, bundling and compiling code, live-reloading when changes occur, and more. The actual script and its functionality are defined by you or your project's setup.

4. Continuous Monitoring: In many cases, `npm run dev` will also monitor your project's files for changes. When it detects changes, it may trigger automatic code recompilation or server restart, allowing you to see the immediate effects of your code edits during development.

Keep in mind that the exact behavior of `npm run dev` can vary significantly depending on the project's configuration, the specific script you've defined, and the technologies you're using. It is a common practice in web development for setting up a development environment tailored to your project's needs, making it easier to develop, test, and debug your code.
