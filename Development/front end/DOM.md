The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure where each element in the document is a node, and you can manipulate these nodes using programming languages like JavaScript. The DOM provides a way for scripts to access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically.

The DOM consists of the following key components:

Document: The top-level container that represents the entire web page. You can access the document object using document in JavaScript.

Elements: HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more are represented as nodes in the DOM. You can access and manipulate these elements using their corresponding DOM methods and properties.

Nodes: Nodes are individual elements in the DOM tree. They can be elements, text nodes, attribute nodes, etc. Nodes have relationships with each other, forming a hierarchical structure.

Attributes: HTML element attributes like id, class, src, and href are represented as attributes in the DOM. You can access and modify these attributes using DOM methods.

Events: DOM events are actions or occurrences that can be detected and responded to by JavaScript code. Examples of events include clicks, mouse movements, keyboard inputs, and form submissions.
