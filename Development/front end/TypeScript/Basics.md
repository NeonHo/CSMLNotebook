# Type declaration
```TypeScript
let foo:string;
```
`string` is the type.

- If you use a variable, give it a value first to avoid `undefined` error.
- Type declaration is not necessary
	- TS will judge it by itself.
	- If the new value's type is inconsistent with the variable, error.
# TypeScript's compilation
TS -> JS for browser and Node.js


# Value & type

The type is an attribute which is belonged to the value.
