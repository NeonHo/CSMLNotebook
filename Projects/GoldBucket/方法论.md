# The Scientific Method to solve problems:
## Observation
(Identify and clearly define the problem.)
## Research
(Gather data and understand the context.)
## Hypothesis
(Formulate a testable hypothesis or potential solution.)
## Experimentation
(Design and conduct experiments to test the hypothesis.)
## Analysis
(Evaluate the results and interpret the data.)
## Conclusion
(Decide whether to accept or reject the hypothesis.)

## Replication
(Repeat the process to verify results.)
