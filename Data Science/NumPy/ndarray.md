N-dimensional array object.

an efficient multidimensional array 
providing: 
- fast array-oriented arithmetic operations
- flexible _broadcasting_ capabilities

a fast, flexible container for large datasets in Python.

Arrays enable you to perform mathematical operations on whole blocks of data using similar syntax to the equivalent operations between scalar elements.

NumPy enables batch computations with similar syntax to scalar values on built-in Python objects
