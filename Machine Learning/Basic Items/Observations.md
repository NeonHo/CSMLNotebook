Today, we only want to clarify only one item -- the observations.

More clearly, one observation is a sample we have collected from the real world.
Generally speaking, one observation is composed by **a feature vector** and **a corresponding label**.
The label mentioned above is the numerical value need to be regressed, or the class value need to be classified.
