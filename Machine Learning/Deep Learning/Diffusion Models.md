# Background
- 图像生成领域常见模型
	- [[Section 1 GAN]]
	- [[Variational Autoencoder]]
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
	- called Diffusion Models
	- for image synthesis
	- OpenAI, Stability AI, Google Brain
# Theory Introduction
- From noise to objective data sample
	- noise from simple distribution
- 2 procedures (Both are [[Section 4 Markov Chain]]):
	- forward (diffusion process)
	- reverse
		- to generate data samples (as the generator from [[Section 1 GAN]])
