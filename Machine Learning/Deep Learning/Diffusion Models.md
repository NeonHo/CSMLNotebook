# Background
- 图像生成领域常见模型
	- [[Section 1 GAN]]
	- [[Variational Autoencoder]]
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)
	- called Diffusion Models
	- for image synthesis
	- OpenAI, Stability AI, Google Brain
# Theory Introduction
- From noise to objective data sample
	- noise from simple distribution
- 2 procedures (Both are [[Section 4 Markov Chain]]):
	- forward (diffusion process)
	- reverse
		- to generate data samples (as the generator from [[Section 1 GAN]])
			- the generator of GAN will change the dimension.
			- DDPM will keep the dimension

		- $x_0 \rightarrow x_T$ is forward
			- original image is added noise gradually to pure noise.
			- [[Section 4 Markov Chain]]  $q(x_{1:T}|x_o)=\prod_{t=1}^Tq(x_t|x_{t-1})$  
		- $x_T\rightarrow x_0$ is reverse
			- random noise is recovered to input image.
			- learn a denoising process.
