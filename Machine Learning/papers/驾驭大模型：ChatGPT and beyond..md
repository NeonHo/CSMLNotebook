# Introduction
- rapid development recently
- address multi NLP tasks.
- Effectively and efficiently requires understanding.

- Working with LLMs in downstream NLP tasks.
- Why or why not use LLMs
- How to select the most suitable LLM.
	- Model size
	- computational requirements
	- existing domain-specific pre-trained models.
- For better leverage the power

- Paper Structure:
	- brief introduction to LLMs
		- GPT
		- BERT
	- critical factors from the data
		- pre-training data
		- training/tuning data
		- test data
	- various concrete NLP tasks
		- knowledge-intensive task
			- Q&A
			- conversation
			- inference
		- traditional NLU(Nature Language Understanding) tasks
			- Named Entity Recognition (NER)[[Named Entity Recognition]]
		- generation task
- Analyze the abilities of LLM.
	- LLMs v.s.  fine-tuned models.
	- LLMs
		- huge language  models
		- pretrained on large amounts of datasets 
		- without tuning on data for specific tasks
	- fine-tuned models  less than 20B params
		- smaller
		- pretrained
		- further tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset.
- summarize
	- Natural language understanding.
		- generalize to out-of-distribution data
		- with few training data.
	- Natural language generation
		- create text for various applications
	- Knowledge-intensive tasks
		- requiring domain-specific expertise
		- requiring general world knowledge.
	- Reasoning ability
		- decision-making
		- problem-solving
# Practical Guide for Models
- sota LLMs
	- differ in 
		- training strategies
		- model architectures
		- use cases
	- 3 types
		- encoder-decoder
		- encoder-only
		- decoder-only
	- evolutionary tree
		- decoder-only (gradually dominating)
			- 2021 game-changing LLMs GPT-3
			- boom
		- encoder-only
			- BERT
			- fade away
