- Quantization: network compression
- Re-parameterize: emerging technique to improve model performance
- both is individually.
- Combine is lack
- RepQ
	- simultaneous application
	- apply quantization to re-parameterized network.
	- the test stage weights
		- a differentiable function of trainable parameters
