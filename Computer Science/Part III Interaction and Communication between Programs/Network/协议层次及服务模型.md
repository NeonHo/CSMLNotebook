模块化从而实现对复杂系统进行简化。

- 分层
	- 大问题分解
	- new tech switch 对上层透明
	- communication using the below services from the below layer
	- the set of rules the current layer need to obey during actions.
	- Each layer will generate some new services when communicating with the equal layer.
	- To realize the communication of the current layer, we use the service below.
	- The goal of the current layer is to provide the better services.
- Protocol is horizon
- Service is vertical
	- SAP service access point
		- socket
		- TCP provide service to specify the corresponding app
		- primitive(原语): the way the below layer provide to give the services.
			- Socket API
		- connection-oriented
			- handshake
			- prepare for communication
		- connectionless service
			- UDP
- DU data unit
	- SDU the up layer give to the below layer for transmission
	- PDU = SDU from up layer (may divide into segmentations optionally / or combined into one data) + Header which contains Interface Control Information (ICI) from current layer
	- TCP: segment
	- Net: package 分组/IP数据报
	- Link: frame
	- Physical: Bit
