# WHERE
Use together with `SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE`.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM player WHERE level = 1 AND level < 5;
SELECT * FROM player WHERE level BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

SELECT * FROM player WHERE level > 1 AND level < 5 OR exp < 1 AND exp > 5;
SELECT * FROM player WHERE level IN (1, 3, 5);
```
- `OR`â€™s priority is lower than `AND`.
- `IN` is used for multiple selection.
