"Vite" is a build tool and development server that is designed to optimize the development of web applications, particularly those using modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js and React. It aims to provide a fast development experience by leveraging ES modules, native ES modules in modern browsers, and fast development server technology.

Here are the primary commands associated with Vite:

1. `vite`: When you run `vite` or `vite serve`, it starts a development server for your project. It serves your project files, transpiles your code (if needed), and enables hot module replacement (HMR), allowing you to see immediate updates as you make changes to your code during development.

2. `vite build`: Running `vite build` generates a production-ready build of your project. It typically optimizes your code, bundles assets, and prepares your application for deployment. The output can be found in the `dist` or `build` directory, depending on your project's configuration.

3. `vite preview`: After running `vite build`, you can use `vite preview` to preview the production build locally. This command starts a local server to serve your production-ready code so that you can verify that everything works as expected before deploying it to a production server.

Vite's development server is known for its speed, as it leverages ES modules to achieve fast initial page loads and HMR to quickly update your application as you code. The `vite build` command is used to optimize your application for production, including tree-shaking and minification.

To use Vite, you typically create a Vite project by running `npm init vite` or `yarn create vite`, configure your project as needed, and then use the mentioned commands for development and building. Make sure to refer to Vite's official documentation for detailed usage instructions and customization options based on your specific project requirements.
