The OS layer is the middle layer between application programs and hardware, such as processor, main memory and I/O devices.
1. To prevent the hardware being abused by the programs which are out of control.
2. To make the control of the complicate hardware more convenient and simple, OS offers unified API to applications.

To realize the unified strategies for apps, we need to introduce the abstraction as follows:
# 1 Abstract
## 1.1 Processes=CPU+Main Memory+I/O Devices

- process
	- Thread
- context: runtime state informations.
- system call
- process context switching
## 1.2 Virtual memory=Main Memory+I/O Devices
- The same memory structure for all process
- contains on Linux
	- Address space distribution
		- Read-only code & data from object files.
		- Read / write data (e.g. global variables)
		- heap (`malloc`) small → big
		- shared libraries, standard libraries (e.g. `printf` function)
		- stack (call function) big → small
		- kernel
## 1.3 Files=I/O Devices
> Everything is File.

- Keyboard
- mouse
- disk
- display
- network

- read & write
- input & output
