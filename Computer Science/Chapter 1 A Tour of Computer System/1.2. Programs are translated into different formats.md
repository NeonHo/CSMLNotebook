My `hello.c` file is as follows:
![[Pasted image 20230912083110.png]]
# 1 gcc compile system
![[Pasted image 20230912083037.png]]
generate a hello.c
![[Pasted image 20230912083403.png]]
## 1.1 Preprocessor

Insert the source code of the include file into `hello.c` to generate `hello.i`.
## 1.2 Compiler
`hello.i` to `hello.s`
Lexical Analysis
Syntax Analysis
Semantic Analysis
Intermediate Code Generation
Code Optimization
## 1.3 Assembler
Based on the instruction set, we can translate the `hello.s` into machine code,
then pack these code lines as a ==relocatable object file== `hello.o`.
## 1.4 Linker
If we call `printf()`, a standard C function, the compiler will translate the code of this function as a machine code object file `printf.o`.
Linker will relocate `hello.o` and `printf.o` and link them into an executable file `hello`.
# 2 Why do we need to learn this?
## 2.1 Optimizing program performance
`switch` or `if, else if, else`
`while` or `for`

## 2.2 Understanding link-time error
Static variable or global variable
Static library or dynamic library

## 2.3 Avoiding security holes
How store?
Wrong writing way.
