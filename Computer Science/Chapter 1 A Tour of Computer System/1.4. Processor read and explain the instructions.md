Shell is a command explanation program.
When we run it, it will be waiting for our command.

If the first word is not a known inner command to shell, shell will regard the word as a executable file name and run it.

When the file is completely running, shell will continue to wait for the next command.

Chapter 8 will build a simple shell.
