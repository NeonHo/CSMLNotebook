# 1 Hardware Organization of a System
![[Pasted image 20230912104425.png]]
## 1.1 CPU
Central Processing Unit
### 1.1.1 Program Count
The number of bit is equal to a word.
If the memory unit is 32 bit, a word is 4 Byte.
If the memory unit is 64 bit, a word is 8 Byte.

The CPU will execute the instruction code which is pointed to by the PC register.

Then the PC register will be updated to point to the next instruction.
> May be not next to the previous instruction in real memory.


### 1.1.2 Register File and ALU

When CPU executes one calculation, CPU will read the variable $a$ and $b$ from memory and store them in registers $X$ and $Y$, then calculate the result using ALU.
The result of ALU will be move in to $X$ or $Y$ to replace with the original data.

## 1.2 Main Memory (DRAM)

Dynamic Random-Access Memory

When CPU executes instructions, it needs to read the instructions and data from main memory, where programs and data store.

A big array from zero address.
## 1.3 Bus

Go through the whole system

Memory bus and System bus.

The one-word block is transit through bus.

## 1.4 I/O Device

Mouse, Keyboard, Display, Disk and so on.

The controller or adapter between device and I/O bus is responsible for data transition between device and I/O bus.

Chapter 6 and 10.
# 2 Run hello program
![[Pasted image 20230912091854.png]]
1. We use I/O device, keyboard, to input our command, this command will be read by [[#2.1 Shell]], then sent by shell from I/O device into CPU's register through I/O bus, I/O bridge, I/O interface in CPU.

2. During our inputting, `./hello` will be sent by System bus, I/O bridge and Memory bus, then store into memory units.
When we "enter" using keyboard, [[#2.1 Shell]] will know that our command is completed.

Because of the "enter" input, shell will call a lot of instructions to load the executable file we specified.

Then the executable file `hello` will be copied from disk to main memory directly through [[#2.2 DMA]] without CPU.

CPU will run the code `main()` in `hello`.

The CPU will copy the string `"Hello, world!\n"` into register, and then send them to I/O device display through bus.
## 2.1 Shell

Shell is a command explanation program.
When we run it, it will be waiting for our command.

If the first word is not a known inner command to shell, shell will regard the word as a executable file name and run it.

When the file is completely running, shell will continue to wait for the next command.

Chapter 8 will build a simple shell.

## 2.2 DMA
Direct Memory Access

## 2.3 Shorten the time

During the running of the code, the data will be moved anywhere, and consume a lot of time.

The system design task is to shorten this time.
# 3 Caches Matter

The faster the memory device is, the more expensive we need to cost.
The lager the memory device is, the slower the access speed is.

The higher performance the CPU has, the more cache levels are required.

The latter level of memory is regarded as the cache of the previous faster one.

Chapter 6.
# 5 The Operating System manages Hardware
The OS layer is the middle layer between application programs and hardware, such as processor, main memory and I/O devices.
1. To prevent the hardware being abused by the programs which are out of control.
2. To make the control of the complicate hardware more convenient and simple, OS offers unified API to applications.

To realize the unified strategies for apps, we need to introduce the abstraction as follows:
## Abstract
### Files=I/O Devices

### Virtual memory=Main Memory+I/O Devices
### Processes=CPU+Main Memory+I/O Devices
