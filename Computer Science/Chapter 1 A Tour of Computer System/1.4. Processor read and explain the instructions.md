The number of bit is equal to a word.
If the memory unit is 32 bit, a word is 4 Byte.
If the memory unit is 64 bit, a word is 8 Byte.

The CPU will execute the instruction code which is pointed to by the PC register.

Then the PC register will be updated to point to the next instruction.

Shell is a command explanation program.
When we run it, it will be waiting for our command.

If the first word is not a known inner command to shell, shell will regard the word as a executable file name and run it.

When the file is completely running, shell will continue to wait for the next command.

Chapter 8 will build a simple shell.
